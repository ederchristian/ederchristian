Hi everyone! I'm Eder Christian, a web developer, currently living in Sao Paulo - Brazil. I'm a passionate about technology and entrepreneurship, always looking for new opportunities and new connections with other people. I've got an entrepreneur mindset.


> I truly believe that life really begins when we leave our comfort zone.


I love to make things for the web and to put my endeavor on it. In this path, each passing day I wanna get more envolved with the open source community.
