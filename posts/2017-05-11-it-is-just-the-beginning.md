Hi everyone!

This is my first public post - following this style as a blog - on the internet, and writen in English, which is not my mother tongue. I'll also publish some posts in Portuguese here, anyway. Nowadays my English is rusty and I must practice more and more - and this is a great way to do it.

For the past months I've been wondering about my purpose in life and about my happiness. Truth be told, I started to live the way I want since last year. I'm 24 now and I think there is always time to change something, to improve, to grow up in life.

I do love technology and I've realized I want to work with programming for the rest of my life. That makes me feel very happy. Practicing sports, learning something new, traveling, playing video-games and other amazing things make me feel happy too.

I intend with this blog to expose some thoughts and what I think can help other people.

Living life, talking to great people, studying a lot, reading great books, all these things, I really appreciate all of it! Each day I've got the possibility to grow up. That's my mindset.

And yeah, I know it. You can say as Rocky said:

> The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

I agree with that, but I mean, I must live the way I always can say to myself:

> Life is worth living!

The point is to find what we'd love to do. And go on. Living this way I think it's easier and lighter. We'll always do our utmost to reach our goals.

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. - Steve Jobs

As I wrote on About section:

> I love to make things for the web and to put my endeavor on it. In this path, each passing day I wanna get more envolved with the open source community.

Nowadays it's important to me. Getting more envolved with the community, programming, studying, sharing experiences, being happy. This is just the beginning.

What is your purpose?
