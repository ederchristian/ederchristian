I'll also publish some posts in Portuguese here, anyway. Nowadays my English is rusty and I must practice more and more - and this is a great way to do it.</p>\n<p>For the past months I've been wondering about my purpose in life and about my happiness. Truth be told, I started to live the way I want since last year. I'm 24 now and I think there is always time to change something, to improve, to grow up in life.</p>\n<p>I do love technology and I've realized I want to work with programming for the rest of my life. That makes me feel very happy. Practicing sports, learning something new, traveling, playing video-games and other amazing things make me feel happy too.</p>\n<p>I intend with this blog to expose some thoughts and what I think can help other people.</p>\n<p>Living life, talking to great people, studying a lot, reading great books, all these things, I really appreciate all of it! Each day I've got the possibility to grow up. That's my mindset.</p>\n<p>And yeah, I know it. You can say as Rocky said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree with that, but I mean, I must live the way I always can say to myself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life is worth living!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point is to find what we'd love to do. And go on. Living this way I think it's easier and lighter. We'll always do our utmost to reach our goals.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUBAwT/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAElfabBaH//xAAbEAEBAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgAEERIUIf/aAAgBAQABBQLsi6lNuRkQOXCNz7//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAZEAACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARESMWH/2gAIAQEABj8CUSdNEy1m5NZ//8QAHBABAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUExUWGB/9oACAEBAAE/IWwhaYrnuK3aUHXsxFnjcZuSAEx1maP0n//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQoA//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAbEAACAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMaGBQf/aAAgBAQABPxAgJSFaNDyGu5WaJ9VyXYBRvfsKhjAMEGaASZUXXAj6Z3yf/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\"\n        alt=\"Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (P&amp;B photo)\"\n        title=\"Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (P&amp;B photo)\"\n        data-src=\"/static/b4012403e2b4554da092768839518f23/6a068/01-it-is-just-the-beginning-steve-jobs.jpg\"\n        data-srcset=\"/static/b4012403e2b4554da092768839518f23/09b79/01-it-is-just-the-beginning-steve-jobs.jpg 240w,\n/static/b4012403e2b4554da092768839518f23/7cc5e/01-it-is-just-the-beginning-steve-jobs.jpg 480w,\n/static/b4012403e2b4554da092768839518f23/6a068/01-it-is-just-the-beginning-steve-jobs.jpg 960w,\n/static/b4012403e2b4554da092768839518f23/72e01/01-it-is-just-the-beginning-steve-jobs.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
