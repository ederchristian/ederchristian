Build relationships of trust with those around you (story time…).

You can be an amazing developer, but if you don’t build trust with the people around you, you won’t be given the opportunities that lead to career growth.

When a project becomes more complex, it requires more collaboration. And if you’re not someone who can be trusted to work well with others, you’re gonna find yourself stuck on the sidelines, possibly facing career stagnation.

> Even If you’re not aggressive or arrogant, even small actions what we might call microaggressions or trust busters can have a similar impact over time. Maybe you cut people off in meetings, or you keep mispronouncing someone’s name, or you’re quick to dismiss others’ ideas. These behaviors, even if unintentional, can erode trust over time and when trust starts to slip, so the opportunities that you see.

> It’s a culture where everybody wins. This means creating a safe environment where no one is thrown under the bus and everyone’s brought to the finish line together. By avoiding judging, blaming or shaming, you also contribute to this team dynamic that builds trust, and people can sense that, and they’ll want to work with you.

> The accumulation of opportunities leads to massive growth.

> Good solutions speak for themselves.
