Eight years ago, I didn’t know tech was for me. I was in a small town in Brazil, no computer, just dreams. Now, after 5 years at a Brazilian startup, I’m 3 years into coding for a US company and starting something new.

I grew up in a poor family, public schools (not much to work with). Education in Brazil isn’t perfect, but it gave me a shot. I’ve got a technical course in Computing, a degree in IT Management, and a postgraduate in Web Projects. A lot of what I know came from teaching myself too—like learning English from scratch online. Moved to São Paulo in 2017 with a junior front-end job and almost no money. Spent 5 years at StartSe, an education startup—started as a dev, became a partner, worked sales, marketing, even video editing. Hit over 70 tech events. Then, 3 years ago, Automatiq in New York called—the technology leader within ticket resale, providing resellers of all sizes pricing automation, automated distribution, data analytics, order processing, and consignment.

I started with computer support, moved to WordPress at a small agency, picked up HTML, CSS, React, Next.js. Now it’s React, TypeScript mostly. Learning some backend with Elixir now too. My foundation isn’t perfect. I’ve learned what I needed when I needed it. Good people helped me get here, and I’m thankful for that every day.

Eder’s Path is where I’m at now, sharing what I’ve picked up in 8 years, tech and life. I’m not done growing. Been coding for a while, but I want my skills stronger—front-end, back-end, tools, whatever comes. It’s not just work. I got sedentary, then flipped it after COVID with gym, better food, better mental health. Slipped lately, but I’ll get back. This is me, a Brazilian dev with Asperger’s, putting it out there. Real stuff, no filter.

I’ll write weekly: tech lessons, life lessons, whatever hits me. If you’re into building something too, stay with me. What’s one thing you want to learn or fix? Tell me on X [@ederchristian_](https://x.com/ederschristian_). I’d like to know.
