I’m a big fan of remote work, but there’s one thing that remote work will never replace: meeting your team face-to-face. Last week, Automatiq brought our 4th Annual All Hands Event from New York to São Paulo, gathering our U.S. and Brazil teams together. It was awesome!

We spent four intense days in São Paulo focused on Automatiq’s vision, future plans, and the role of AI in our business. Beyond just code and design, it was great seeing the diversity within our Brazilian dev team: people from different cities, ages, backgrounds (finance, education, media), all connecting naturally offline.

Meeting Jake Trimble in person stood out. He’s genuinely great at clearly communicating ideas and projects, and it was cool to get a closer look at the product he’s leading. And Shane Helget, whom I’ve spoken with for years, was exactly as sharp, friendly, and interested in person as he is online.

If you’re working remotely, take every opportunity you can to meet your teammates face-to-face. After three years working at an American company from Brazil, moments like these confirm exactly why I chose this path: to contribute, learn, connect, and grow beyond borders.
