  <p>I'm from Lorena, a small city in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>

  <p>
    I've been curious about computers since I was a kid. At 17, I earned a
    technical certificate in computing. Three years later, I enrolled in a
    public college to study Information Technology Management.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point, we still didn't have a computer at home. My first one came
    through a local NGO — an old and simple PC from a City Hall project. Years
    later, I used my savings to buy a used MacBook Air. That's when I fell in
    love with Apple and decided I wanted to learn how to code. I considered
    Swift and Objective-C, but after some research, I chose web development and
    found my place in front-end.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2015, I completed a postgrad certificate in Web Application Development.
    That's when I consider my real career to have started — even though I barely
    knew how to program at the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Most of what I truly learned came through doing: working on real projects,
      attending events, studying on my own, and asking more experienced
      developers the right questions. I built my skills outside the classroom,
      not in it.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>Over the next five years, everything changed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      I started at a small marketing agency in my hometown, working with design
      and WordPress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then I dropped everything to move to São Paulo and work at StartSe, an
      education startup, building basic landing pages with HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
    </li>
    <li>
      I visited Silicon Valley for the first time and took business courses
      while helping at a tech event.
    </li>
    <li>
      I worked across departments (sales, marketing, design, and video editing)
      until I eventually led a squad and became a partner in the company.
    </li>
    <li>
      I helped build a custom online events platform using React and Next.js,
      which became critical during the pandemic.
    </li>
    <li>
      I taught myself English from scratch through online courses and 500+ hours
      on Cambly.
    </li>
    <li>
      I attended over 60 tech events and meetups in Brazil and built meaningful
      connections in the dev community.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In 2022, I joined <a
      href="https://automatiq.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Automatiq</a
    >, a U.S. based company in New York, where I work remotely as a developer.
    We build automation tools for ticket brokers, covering pricing, invoicing,
    and more across multiple vendors.
  </p>

  <p>
    That same year, I created the official website for Padre Fábio de Melo, one
    of Brazil's most influential Catholic figures, and became responsible for
    his entire tech stack — including platforms like YouTube, Spotify, Apple
    Music, and Deezer.
  </p>

  <p>
    In March 2024, I launched my first course (in Portuguese) about productivity
    with AI, sharing the systems and tools that helped me get here.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm excited for what's next — building with code, intention, and clarity.
