    <p style="padding-top: 24px;">I came from outside the tech bubble.</p>
    <p>
      No Silicon Valley origin story. Just a secondhand MacBook, discipline, a
      lot of mistakes, and a quiet will to keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2018, I had the chance to visit Silicon Valley while helping at a tech
      event. That trip shifted how I saw technology, career, and what is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      My career started in Brazil, but my vision has always been global. Today,
      I work remotely for a U.S. company based in New York, building a life
      shaped by code, clarity, and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my <strong>inner commit</strong>: to keep building a life that
      makes sense, from the inside out.
